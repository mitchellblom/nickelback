# NSS Kill Nickelback Exercise

1. Define a List, named `goodSongs`, that will hold tuples consisting of two strings.
1. Define a HashSet, named `allSongs`, that contains 7 tuples. Each tuple should contain two string values:
    - The name of an artist
    - A song by that artist
1. Once the set is populated with 7 tuples, iterate over the set of songs, and check if the band name is "Nickelback".
1. If the band is **not** Nickelback, then add it to the `goodSongs` list.
1. Use another `foreach` loop to print out all the good songs.
